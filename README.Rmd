# CBTF: Caught by the Fuzz! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ-mpul94eo"><img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" height="120" /></a>

A very simple mechanism to fuzz-test the exported functions of an R package.
At the moment this is extremely limited: it operates only on the first
argument and it doesn't introduce any randomness. However, it's convenient
when there are a large number of functions to test.

## Usage

```{r}
library(CBTF)
funs <- get_exported_functions("glue")
what <- TRUE
fuzz(funs, what)
```
