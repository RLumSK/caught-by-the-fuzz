A very simple mechanism to fuzz-test the exported functions of an R
package. At the moment this is extremely limited: it operates only on
the first argument and it doesnâ€™t introduce any randomness. However,
itâ€™s convenient when there are a large number of functions to test.

## Usage

``` r
library(CBTF)
funs <- get_exported_functions("mime")
what <- TRUE
fuzz(funs, what)
```

    ## 
    ##  ðŸš¨   CAUGHT BY THE FUZZ!   ðŸš¨
    ## 
    ## FAIL: guess_type ( logical )
    ##     a character vector argument expected 
    ## 
    ## FAIL: parse_multipart ( logical )
    ##     $ operator is invalid for atomic vectors

The first occurrence is a false positive, as the message returned
indicates that the input was checked and the function returned cleanly.
The second case instead reveals that the function didnâ€™t validate its
input: indeed, it expected an environment, and used the `$` operation on
it without checking.
